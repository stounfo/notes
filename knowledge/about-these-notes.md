# About These Notes

There are several types of notes:

- [[daily-note|Daily Notes]] for tracking habits, to-dos, journaling, etc.
- [[source-note|Source Notes]] a centralized inbox for capturing incoming
  information.
- [[knowledge-note|Knowledge Notes]] for keeping knowledge.

## Motivation

- Having a single repository for accumulated knowledge.
- Connection and search helps to quickly find actual information.
- Helps to better understand and remember information.

## Implementation

### Project Structure

The folder structure is as flat as possible, with minimal nesting:

```
daily/      <- Folder for daily notes
knowledge/  <- Folder for knowledge notes
source/      <- Folder for source notes
```

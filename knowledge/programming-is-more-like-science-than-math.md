# Programming Is More Like Science Than Math

Scientific theories and laws can't be proven correct in contrast to
mathematical theorems. Science does not work by proving things correct but by
proving them incorrect.

For instance, there is no way to prove that `F = ma` is correct. However, it
can be proven incorrect by finding a single case where it doesn't hold (this
case was found by Einstein).

Similarly, software can't be proven correct but it can be proven incorrect
using [[software-testing]].

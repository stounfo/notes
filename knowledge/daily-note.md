# Daily Notes

These notes track habits, to-dos, journaling, etc.

## Motivation

- Prevents forgetfulness by tracking tasks.
- Helps develop and maintain habits.
- Provides a space for journaling thoughts and reflections.

## Implementation

Each note is stored as a Markdown file with a unique name.

- File name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-WEEKDAY.md`.
- Main heading format should math the filename but use a more human-readable
  format.

All notes should be placed in the `daily/` folder.

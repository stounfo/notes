# Learning English Vocabulary

This is a cheat sheet on how to add new words in English to vocabulary.

## Workflow

1. Find a word in a book, article, etc. Give priority to the words with high
   frequency and can be useful in daily life.
2. Create flashcards. Each card should illustrate one key aspect of the word
   from [[#What to Check When Adding a New Word]].

# Article :: Polymorphism in Simple Words

Polymorphism != OOP

A literal translation of the word "polymorphism" is "many forms".

Polymorphism is related to a type system.

Everything that can contain or process different types at compile time or
runtime is polymorphic.

```
               polymorphism
               /          \
      universal            ad-hoc
      /        \          /       \
parametric  inclusion  overloading  coercion
```

generic = parametric polymorphism

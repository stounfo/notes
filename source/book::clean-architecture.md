# Book :: Clean Architecture

## Introduction

Getting a program to just work is not hard; getting it right is hard.

A "right" program one that is easy to create and maintain.

## What Is Design and Architecture

There is no difference between design and architecture.

> The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required
> to build and maintain the required system.

There are interesting graphs in the 'the signature of a mess' subchapter

It seems that the author suggests that it is better develop a program 'right'
from the beginning. I'm not sure I agree. I think that common view that
architecture and other best practices are not so important in a startup.

I didn't find definitions of 'architecture' and 'design' in the chapter.
